## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

1. I learned why my flex items are not centering it's because my flex container is small after i made it bigger it working
2. how margin work completely
   margin:(TOP RIGTH BOTTOM LEFT); - 4 values // margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
   margin:(TOP (RIGTH LEFT) BOTTOM); - 3 values // margin: 1px 3px 4px;
   margin:((TOP BOTTOM) (LEFT RIGTH)); - 4 values // margin: 1px 4px;  or  margin: 2px auto;
   margin:((ALL)); - 4 values // margin:10px  05 margin: 0;


### Continued development

I still need to improve Flex, grid, and media Queries...
